# LiveCoders polling function

A Lambda function that will trigger every 5 minutes and check out of all of the [LiveCoders](https://livecoders.dev) who are live and insert entries into a DynamoDB table.

For notice, it was first triggered at 01:05 UTC on November 18 so some streams may have already been going for the early datapoints
